DOCUMENTATION

We can use the program "pydoc" included in the Python programming utilities. For example we can set up a server:

	pydoc -p 8080

And then, all the documentation is accessible using a web browser pointing to 

	localhost:8080

Alternativelly, it can be dumped to HTML using

	pydoc -w predict

... will produce predict.html
